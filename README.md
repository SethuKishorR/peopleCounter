# People Counter Web App

## Overview
This repository contains a simple web application for counting and saving the number of people entered, designed with basic HTML, Bootstrap for styling, and JavaScript for functionality.

## Features
- **Counting Functionality:** Tracks and displays the number of times the "ADD" button is clicked.
- **Save Entries:** Allows saving of counted entries with the "SAVE" button.
- **Form Submission:** Includes a form for entering email addresses and a checkbox for confirmation.

## How It Works
- **Counting Mechanism:** Utilizes JavaScript to increment and display the count of entries.
- **Saving Entries:** Stores the count with a timestamp in the "Previous Entries" section upon clicking "SAVE".
- **Form Handling:** Prevents default form submission behavior to handle counts and form reset.

2. Open `index.html` in a web browser.

4. Click "SAVE" to save the counted entries in the "Previous Entries" section.

## Notes
